				<h2 id="mobile-header">What is CryptoHub?</h2>
				<p id="crypto-definition">"A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a digital currency designed to work
				as a medium of exchange through a computer network that is not reliant on any central authority, such as
				a government or bank, to uphold or maintain it. Individual
				coin ownership records are stored in a digital ledger, which is a computerized database using strong
				cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify
				the transfer of coin ownership.Despite
				their name, cryptocurrencies are not necessarily considered to be currencies in the traditional sense
				and while varying categorical treatments have been applied to them, including classification as
				commodities, securities, as well as currencies,
				cryptocurrencies are generally viewed as a distinct asset class in practice.Some crypto schemes use
				validators to maintain the cryptocurrency. In a proof-of-stake model, owners put up their tokens as
				collateral. In return, they get authority
				over the token in proportion to the amount they stake. Generally, these token stakers get additional
				ownership in the token over time via network fees, newly minted tokens or other such reward mechanisms".</p>
				<p><strong>CryptoHUB</strong> allows you to explore the cryptocurrency market and its rates that are updated 
				quickly making sure you never fall behind. Provided is a portfolio section that allows you to input the
				contents of your wallet to calculate total crypto assets value. There is no need to sign-up or login as data 
				is saved locally on your system therefore, when you re-visit the site, your portfolio will be updated to 
				the current rate and ready to be modified.</p>
